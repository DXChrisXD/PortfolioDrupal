# The [theme name].libraries.yml defines all the libraries used by the theme.
# Libraries are defined here, but are not included in your site until they are
# added in the theme's info file, in a template using attach_library(), or by
# some other programmatic means.

# Each library must have a unique name within the module or theme defining it.
# For example, every module can define a library named 'global-styling,' but
# each module can only have one library with that name. The libraries will be
# referenced using the theme name and library name together.

# Libraries can have any name, but it is common to define one named
# 'global-styling' which provides the CSS that is loaded on every page.

  # This is where you define CSS files. The CSS files conceptually use SMACSS
  # categories. See https://smacss.com/. There are 5 categories, processed in
  # this order:
  # - base
  # - layout
  # - component (In SMACSS this is normally where 'module' goes.)
  # - state
  # - theme
  #
  # It is important to note that load order of CSS files is based on the
  # category, but all themes are kept together as one large group, and seperate
  # from module CSS. Module CSS is also loaded based on SMACSS categories, but
  # loaded first. This ensures that all module CSS comes before theme CSS.
